            <p>
              My goal is to provide quality care in a timely manner. In order to do so, I have had to implement an appointment/cancellation policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your early cancellation will give another person the opportunity to have access to timely care. This policy enables me to better utilize available appointments for my clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time of booking your appointment you will be asked to pay a <strong>$10 deposit</strong> that will be credited towards your treatment(s). Time has been specifically reserved for your appointment, procedure, or treatment.
            </p>

            <h3 className="h3">Cancellations & Rescheduling</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment you must call <strong>48 hours</strong> prior to your appointment time and your deposit will either be refunded or pushed for a future appointment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Providing less than <strong>24 hours</strong> notice will require you to pay the cancellation fee which is the remaining balance of your booked service.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="h3">Late Policy</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You will receive a grace period of <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</li>
              <li>
                If you arrive more than 10 minutes late then it is considered a no-show and you will be charged the cancellation fee which is the remaining amount of your booked service.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="h3">Reminders</h3>
            <p>
              You will receive text and email reminders 3–4 days prior to your appointment. Please make any needed adjustments to your appointment then to avoid late rescheduling or no-show fees. If appointments are missed or cancelled outside of the 24 hour window then <strong>100% of the service payment is required</strong> prior to booking again.
            </p>

            <h3 className="h3">Guests & Children</h3>
            <p>
              This is your time to relax and I want you to take full advantage of that! So, I kindly request that children do not accompany you to your spa visit unless they are scheduled for a service. I cannot have any additional guests back in the treatment room at this time.
            </p>

            <h3 className="h3">Health</h3>
            <p>Please reschedule if you are not feeling well.</p>

            <h3 className="h3">Clients 16–18</h3>
            <p>
              First time clients under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at the arrival of their first appointment to sign a minor consent waiver. If the client is 16 years old or older, the parent or legal guardian may leave for the remainder of the service, and does not have to present for the child's future appointment if they choose; unless the child is receiving a new service, or is paying with a credit or debit card other than their own.
            </p>

            <p><strong>I am happy to answer any question regarding this policy.</strong></p>
